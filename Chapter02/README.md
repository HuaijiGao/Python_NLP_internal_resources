# NLTK, Spacy and Visualization Techniques

## NLTK

NLTK is one of the major NLP packages in Python. It is targeted at learners rather than being a production library which makes a good starting point for our purposes.

The first step is to import nltk then make sure that all the necessary files are downloaded.

```
import nltk
nltk.download("all", quiet=True)
```

If you are running on your personal machine (not within Google colab), you only need to do this once.

NLTK offers a special module called "book" which can be imported using `from nltk.book import *`

After printing a welcome message, it loads the text of several books (this will take a few seconds).

```
from nltk.book import *
```
