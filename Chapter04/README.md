## Naive Bayes and Sentiment Classification
 
In this tutorial, we will focus on the topic of sentiment classification and how it can be achieved using the Naive Bayes classifier.

## Why sentiment analysis?
Sentiment analysis involves the detection of attitudes in text data, which can be useful in a variety of applications such as:

- Movie reviews: determining if a review is positive or negative
- Product reviews: understanding customer opinions about a product
- Public sentiment: monitoring consumer confidence or political opinions
- Prediction: predicting election outcomes or market trends based on sentiment
- Basic Sentiment Classification

The goal of sentiment classification is to determine whether the attitude of a given text is positive or negative. This is a simple task that can be achieved using machine learning techniques such as the Naive Bayes classifier.

## Text Classification: Definition
Text classification involves predicting a class label for a given document from a fixed set of classes. In the case of sentiment classification, the classes are positive and negative.

## Hand-coded Rules
One approach to text classification is to use hand-coded rules based on combinations of words or other features. While this approach can achieve high accuracy if the rules are carefully refined by an expert, it can be expensive to build and maintain.

## Supervised Machine Learning
Another approach to text classification is supervised machine learning, which involves training a classifier on a labeled dataset of documents and their corresponding class labels. Popular classifiers for sentiment classification include:

- Naive Bayes
- Logistic regression
- Neural networks
- k-Nearest Neighbors

## Naive Bayes Classifier
The Naive Bayes classifier is a simple and effective probabilistic classifier that is widely used for text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis. The classifier is based on Bayes' theorem, which states that the probability of a hypothesis (such as a document belonging to a particular class) given some observed evidence (such as the words in the document) is proportional to the product of the prior probability of the hypothesis and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.

The "naive" part of the Naive Bayes classifier comes from the assumption that the features (such as the words in a document) are conditionally independent given the class label. While this assumption is often not true in practice, the Naive Bayes classifier can still perform well in many text classification tasks.
