Welcome to our tutorial learning resource for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python! This course is designed to introduce you to the essential concepts and techniques underlying NLP, and to provide you with the skills needed to process and analyse large amounts of natural language data.

In this course, you will learn about important NLP sub-tasks such as accessing corpora, tokenisation, morphological analysis, word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech tagging, and analysing sentence structure. You will also explore practical applications of NLP, including text categorisation, text clustering, text recommendation, and information retrieval.

Throughout the course, you will use both lexical (dictionary-based) and machine learning approaches to gain a comprehensive understanding of NLP techniques. You will also explore advanced topics such as vector semantics and embedding, neural networks and neural language models, deep learning architectures for sequence processing, and transfer learning.

By the end of the course, you will have a strong foundation in NLP and the skills needed to apply this knowledge in real-world settings. Whether you are new to NLP or looking to expand your existing knowledge, this tutorial learning resource is an excellent place to start. So let's get started and unlock the power of NLP in Python!
