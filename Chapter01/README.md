# Introduction to Natural Language Processing

## What is Natural Language Processing?
NLP is a field of study that focuses on designing and analyzing computational algorithms and representations for processing natural human language, making human language accessible to computers.

## The Goals of NLP
The primary goal of NLP is to make computers capable of handling natural human language, such as email, library research, and conversation. However, natural human language is a complex system constructed to convey meaning that is different from vision or any other machine learning task, which makes it difficult for computers to understand. NLP tries to help computers learn language as humans do.

## What's So Special About Human (Natural) Language?
Human language is a system specifically constructed to convey meaning, and it's not produced by a physical manifestation of any kind. Most words are just symbols for an extra-linguistic entity, and the symbols of language can be encoded in several modalities: voice, gesture, writing, etc.

## Why is NLP Hard?
NLP is challenging because the mappings between different levels of language, such as syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, are extremely complex, and the appropriateness of a representation depends on the application.

## Successful NLP Applications and Systems
There are several successful NLP applications and systems, such as search engines, translation, anti-spam, smart assistants, autocomplete, and more. Other applications include sentiment analysis, emotion detection, question answering, text summarization, chatbots, semantic parsing, named entity recognition, speech recognition, text to speech, machine reading comprehension, and more.

## NLP Use Cases
NLP can be used to recognize and predict diseases based on electronic health records and patient's speech, perform sentiment analysis to understand customers' preferences, filter and classify emails, detect fake news, provide voice interfaces, track news and comments for financial traders, select talent recruitment, automate routine litigation tasks, and more.
